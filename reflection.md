- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

This class represents a butterfly performing the methods that were assigned to use from the Contract class. I tried to implement these methods to make it more applicable for a butterfly (input examples given in my main method). I specifically chose a butterfly since its able to perform all of the methods that were picked out for us (with some degree of interpretation, like we wouldn't necessarily say a butterfly "walks", or "picks up" an item, but it does fly, examine things, etc.). 


- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
While I didn't add additional methods alongside those listed in the interface, I tried my best to make meaningful and useful methods for each of the ones listed (although I do think I had some trouble making some intricate enough without specific directions or prompts like we do for our usual assignments). 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Similarly to what I have listed above, one thing I felt didn't work was making my program intricate enough based on the techniques we've learned in class. I feel that to some extent I'm at a place where I know when to use more complicated java features (for exmaple, array lists) based on how it fits into an existing program I made based on the instructions/goals for an assignment. However, when I'm left to write a program from scratch (i.e- not specifically asked to do something for an assignment) I feel that I have more difficulty knowing where I could fit it in and in what context. One thing that I felt went well was being able to tell what I needed to return/how I could manipulate parameters based on their type. The advice I would give to someone taking this course in the future is to make sure to write out your idea for a program on a piece of paper before you start coding. I truly think this is helpful to determine what goals you have for a program and what techniques you know to achieve it.
